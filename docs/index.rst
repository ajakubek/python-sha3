:mod:`python-sha3` --- SHA-3 extension module for Python
========================================================

.. module:: sha3

.. moduleauthor:: Adam Jakubek <ajakubek@gmail.com>

This extension for CPython provides SHA-3 cryptographic function (also known
as Keccak). For more information on the Keccak function, please visit
http://keccak.noekeon.org/

The interface of this module follows conventions from Python's builtin
:mod:`hashlib` module.

It can be used with the following versions of Python:
 - Python 2 - version 2.4 and later are supported
 - Python 3 - tested with versions up to 3.2

Internally :mod:`python-sha3` uses optimized version of the Keccak algorithm,
written and released into the public domain by its designers. 
Both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures are supported (tested on x86 and x86_64
architectures).


Building
========

To build the module, type the following command:

  *python setup.py build*

You may specify additional command line arguments to the build command.
The following options are currently supported:

.. option:: --enable-threads

    Causes :mod:`python-sha3` to release GIL when performing hash computations.
    This option can improve performance of multithreaded code which performs a lot
    of hashing. Note that :mod:`python-sha3` will still acquire a per-object lock,
    so the module is fully thread-safe.

To install the module, issue the following command:

  *python setup.py install*


Classes
=======

Four classes with different digest sizes are currently available:
 - :class:`sha3.sha224` - SHA-3 224 bit digest
 - :class:`sha3.sha256` - SHA-3 256 bit digest
 - :class:`sha3.sha384` - SHA-3 384 bit digest
 - :class:`sha3.sha512` - SHA-3 512 bit digest

The interface of these classes follows conventions from Python's builtin
hashlib module.

:mod:`sha3` hashes
------------------

.. class:: sha224()

  Return a new SHA-3 with 224 bit digest size.

  Sponge function parameters:
    - rate: 1152 bits
    - capacity: 448 bits

.. class:: sha256()

  Return a new SHA-3 with 256 bit digest size.

  Sponge function parameters:
    - rate: 1088 bits
    - capacity: 512 bits

.. class:: sha384()

  Return a new SHA-3 with 384 bit digest size.

  Sponge function parameters:
    - rate: 832 bits
    - capacity: 768 bits

.. class:: sha512()

  Return a new SHA-3 with 512 bit digest size.

  Sponge function parameters:
    - rate: 576 bits
    - capacity: 1024 bits

All of above classes provide the same interface.

Hash object methods:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. method:: sha.update(self, x)

    Update the hash object with message *x*, which can be a string or a buffer
    (`unicode` or `bytes` in Python 3.x).

    Calling :meth:`update()` multiple times is equivalent to a single call with
    a concatenated value of all arguments: ::

        >>> h1 = sha3.sha512()
        >>> h1.update(a)
        >>> h1.update(b)

        >>> h2 = sha3.sha512()
        >>> h2.update(a+b)

        >>> h1.digest() == h2.digest()
        True

.. method:: sha.digest(self)

    Return a string (`bytes` in Python 3.x) with binary digest value.

    Note that this method does not alter state of *self* (:meth:`update()` can
    be called afterwards to extend the hash input message).

.. method:: sha.hexdigest(self)

    Return a string (`unicode` in Python 3.x) with hexadecimal digest value.

    Note that this method does not alter state of *self* (:meth:`update()` can
    be called afterwards to extend the hash input message).

.. method:: sha.copy(self)

    Return a copy of *self*. This method can be called to calculate hashes of
    messages which share the same prefix.

Hash object attributes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. attribute:: sha.digest_size

    Read-only size of message digest in bytes.

.. attribute:: sha.block_size

    Read-only size of internal block size in bytes.
    This is equivalent to ``sha.rate / 8``.

.. attribute:: sha.rate

    Read-only rate of sponge function in bits.

.. attribute:: sha.capacity

    Read-only capacity of sponge function in bits.
