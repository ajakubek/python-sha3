python-sha3 - SHA-3 extension for CPython
=========================================

This extension module for CPython provides SHA-3 cryptographic function (also
known as Keccak).
It can be used with Python 2.x (from 2.4 upwards) and 3.x versions.

Four classes with different digest sizes are currently available:
 - sha3.sha224 - SHA-3 224 bits
 - sha3.sha256 - SHA-3 256 bits
 - sha3.sha384 - SHA-3 384 bits
 - sha3.sha512 - SHA-3 512 bits

The interface of these classes follows conventions from Python's builtin
hashlib module.

Internally python-sha3 uses the optimized version of the Keccak algorithm,
written and released into the public domain by its designers.
Both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures are supported (tested on x86 and x86_64
architectures).

The most current development version is available at:
